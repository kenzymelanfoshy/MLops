## Introduction

This project provides an end-to-end example of how to manage machine learning workflows using MLflow. MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the complete machine learning lifecycle, from experimentation to deployment. It enables data scientists and engineers to track experiments, package code into reproducible runs, and deploy machine learning models to production.
